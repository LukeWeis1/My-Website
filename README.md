# Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio site built with Angular. Itâ€™s a place to share my experience, projects, and education, and to make it easy for people to get in touch with me. I wanted the site to feel simple, interactive, and easy to use on any device.

## Features

### Experience Section
Flip cards that show my roles and responsibilities. Each card flips to reveal more details.

### Projects Section
Tabbed layout for multiple projects. Each project includes details, screenshots, and PDFs.
On iOS devices, PDFs default to download links since Safari only shows the first page in an embedded viewer.

### Education Section
Education info with awards that open in small popups.

### Contact Form
Email form built with EmailJS (no backend required).

### Responsive Design
Works well on both desktop and mobile. SCSS is used for styling and theming.
