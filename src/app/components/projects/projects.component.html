                This personal website was developed as a modern single-page application using Angular, designed to provide a clean, intuitive, and professional browsing experience. The navigation dynamically highlights the active section as users scroll, implemented through an Intersection Observer, offering seamless visual cues that enhance usability and orientation throughout the site.

                Several interactive and visually engaging features have been incorporated to elevate the user experience. The experience section utilizes responsive flip-boxes that reveal detailed information on the reverse side when clicked, while the involvement section presents its content through traditional cards arranged in a balanced layout. Within the projects section, a tabbed interface allows visitors to explore multiple projects efficiently without overwhelming the page with excessive content.

                Styling is managed through SCSS, leveraging variables, nesting, and media queries to ensure the website maintains a polished and cohesive appearance across devices. Design elements such as angled section headers, translucent text boxes layered over background imagery, and smooth visual transitions add depth and a modern aesthetic, all while preserving readability and focus. Flexbox and carefully selected breakpoints ensure the layout remains responsive, adapting between desktop and mobile views.

                <br>
                The contact section includes a functional form integrated with EmailJS, enabling visitors to submit messages directly without requiring a dedicated backend. The form features real-time validation, contextual error messages, and clear visual indicators, guiding users to correct any mistakes in their entries promptly. Subtle enhancements, such as a persistent dark mode toggle and the use of Font Awesome icons contribute to the site's cohesive branding and visual identity.

                <br>
                Altogether, this project demonstrates the practical application of modern frontend technologies, responsive design principles, and user-centric features to deliver a professional and engaging digital portfolio.
